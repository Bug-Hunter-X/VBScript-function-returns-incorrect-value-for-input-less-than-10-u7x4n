This repository contains a VBScript function that exhibits unexpected behavior when the input is less than 10. The function is intended to add 10 to the input if it's greater than 10 and subtract 10 otherwise. However, due to implicit type conversion in VBScript, the function returns incorrect values for inputs less than 10. The bugSolution.vbs file provides a corrected version of the function that addresses this issue. The corrected function explicitly handles the case where x is less than 10, ensuring that the correct value is returned. This example highlights the importance of careful type handling in VBScript to avoid unexpected behavior.
